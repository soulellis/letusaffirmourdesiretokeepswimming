		This is a manifesto, an assemblage, and a proposition formed during the first two weeks of July in Ithaca, New York in 2019. We started with the following questions: How do we address what&rsquo;s truly urgent today? Urgent for whom? We first explored the loaded (and leaded) site of the Ithaca Gun Company and Ithaca Falls. We tested, documented, and performed actions, but nothing really stuck. We are outsiders, after all. Itâ€™s hard to address anything meaningfully before you address yourself. And so we decided to create a resource for ourselves, so that the work we do in the future is grounded in the ideas and questions formed during this time. The following materials are assembled by us, for one another, not for the institutions that bring us together. It is a piece of you and I, to carry us to tomorrow.
